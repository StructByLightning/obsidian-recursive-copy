# Recursive Copy

This plugin adds a context menu item to the nav panel when right clicking a folder that allows you to copy all markdown files in that folder, concatenate them, and place them in the clipboard. Recursive copy can be activated via hotkey (default: unbound), in which case everything in the active file's parent folder will be copied.

Recursive copy is meant to be used to quickly load context into LLMs such as Claude Artifacts or ChatGPT.
